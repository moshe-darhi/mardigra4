    <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
    <p>
      The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the
      city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks
      before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
      of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major
      parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large
      parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five
      days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur
      throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
      balls (some of them masquerade balls).
    </p>
    <p>
      The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes;
      most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
      earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest,
      Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
      krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the
      Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
      marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for
      naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
      Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
      traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are
      strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw
      cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same
      parade schedule and route each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon
      Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and
      follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver
      side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
      Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny
      and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras
      day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex
      and Comus.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the
      mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish,
      Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
      celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of
      the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730
      account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking
      and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The
      Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
      established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras
      took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
      renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In
      1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of
      French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous
      Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835:
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for
      that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the
      mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and
      boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown,
      exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic,
      horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads
      of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts,
      demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the
      moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on
      foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich
      confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing,
      drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend
      their reckless way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to
      organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They
      founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of Comus.
      According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its
      celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival.
      It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead
      in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To
      a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To
      a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder
      of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them
      construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in
      organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and
      economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The
      spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms
      to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents
      the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
      American."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[4] War,
      economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to cancellation
      of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War,
      World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official
      parades were canceled or moved to surrounding communities, such as
      Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came
      to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with
      National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes
      against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating
      morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter
      bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required
      social organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly
      that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
      sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.[5]
      Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes
      provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing
      traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups.
      In protestâ€”and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to
      demand otherwise-private membership listsâ€”the 19th-century krewes Comus
      and Momus stopped parading.[6] Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival
      season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade
      schedule in 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law
      as unconstitutional. Two federal courts later declared that the ordinance
      was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
      association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups
      subject to the ordinance.[7] The US Supreme Court refused to hear the
      city's appeal from this decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership
      is open to anyone who pays dues, and any member can have a place on a
      parade float.
    </p>
    <h2>Effects of Hurricane Katrina</h2>
    <p>
      The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a
      few people to question the future of the city's Mardi Gras celebrations.
      Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play this
      sentiment for electoral advantage[citation needed]. However, the economics
      of Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's revival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed
      for a scaled back celebration to limit strains on city services. However,
      many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so
      negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a
      compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than originally
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its
      traditional route through Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11,
      the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades on
      Saturday, February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras.
      Parades followed daily from Thursday night through Mardi Gras. Other than
      Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New
      Orleans parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to
      Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant
      flooding. Some krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional
      Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage suffered by that
      neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late
      at night they could end. National Guard troops assisted with crowd control
      for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as
      they have many times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged
      in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all
      traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage
      into the designs of the floats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were
      significantly affected by the storm's aftermath. Many had lost most or all
      of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as
      an affirmation of life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more
      barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations
      of living in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina
      refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal
      Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians. By
      the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route,
      and other Krewes expanding their parades Uptown.

        <h2>LaToya Cantrell</h2>
        <p>
          LaToya Cantrell (nÃ©e Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
          politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7,
          2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
          Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New
          Orleans City Council from 2012â€“2018.
        </p>
        <h2>Broadmoor neighborhood work</h2>
        <p>
          Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor
          neighborhood. In 2003, she joined the board of the Broadmoor
          Improvement Association and became president of the association in
          2004.[4] After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans
          following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded
          severely and remained mostly deserted for months afterward. In early
          2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel
          convened by then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called
          for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans neighborhoods to be converted
          into greenspace.[5][6] In her role as president of the association,
          Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize
          opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist
          returning Broadmoor residents in a six-month effort to write a
          recovery plan for the neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from
          2006 through 2012. She and fellow residents formed the Broadmoor
          School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H.
          Wilson school.[8] She served as a founding board member of the
          Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation
          that provided case management and other social services for returning
          residents.[9] She was involved with residents' efforts to reopen
          Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from
          the Carnegie Endowment.[10] She created a partnership between the
          Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation,
          which provided the neighborhood association with office space and
          hosted volunteer groups.[11] She also formed a partnership between the
          Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity
          Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and Wellness Center.
