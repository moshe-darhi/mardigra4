      "Mardi Gras Indians are secretive because only certain people participated
      in masking--people with questionable character. In the old day, the
      Indians were violent. Indians would meet on Mardi Gras; it was a day to
      settle scores." - Larry Bannock, Past President, New Orleans Mardi Gras
      Indian Council
    </p>
    <p>
      Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as much a
      part of that secrecy as any other carnival organization. Their parade
      dates, times and routes are never published in advance, although they do
      tend to gather in the same areas every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the
      African-American communities of New Orleans's inner city. While these
      Indians have paraded for well over a century, their parade is perhaps the
      least recognized Mardi Gras tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mardi Gras Indians--the parade most white people don't see. The
      ceremonial procession is loose, the parade is not scheduled for a
      particular time or route...that is up to the Big Chief." - Larry Bannock
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a "krewe." A krewe often names
      their parade after a particular Roman or Greek mythological hero or god.
      The ranking structure of a Mardi Gras Krewe is a parody of royalty: King,
      Queen, Dukes, Knights, and Captains, or some variation of that theme. Many
      of the more established krewes allow membership by invitation only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few in the ghetto felt they could ever participate in the typical New
      Orleans parade. Historically, slavery and racism were at the root of this
      cultural separation. The black neighborhoods in New Orleans gradually
      developed their own style of celebrating Mardi Gras. Their krewes are
      named for imaginary Indian tribes according to the streets of their ward
      or gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mardi Gras Indians named themselves after native Indians to pay them
      respect for their assistance in escaping the tyranny of slavery. It was
      often local Indians who accepted slaves into their society when they made
      a break for freedom. They have never forgotten this support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long ago, Mardi Gras was a violent day for many Mardi Gras Indians. It was
      a day often used to settle scores. The police were often unable to
      intervene due to the general confusion surrounding Mardi Gras events in
      the city, when the streets were crowded and everyone was masked. This kept
      many families away from the "parade," and created much worry and concern
      for a mother whose children wanted to join the Indians.
